# Spooky Search

A simple image search engine with a lightbox view...except that all image results are *spooky*.
See it in action [here](http://adamdavidcole.github.io/spooky-search/).



### Run
Run the application by opening the index.html file in the root of the folder in any modern browser.

### Tech
The application is made with static HTML, CSS, and pure Javascript. The app gets the photos through the
[flickr.photos.search](https://www.flickr.com/services/api/flickr.photos.search.html) api.
